# Corsair-K55-RGB-Screen-Reactive-Lighting
A simple python program that uses the MSS library to take a screenshot of the active monitor and set the colour of the RGB keyboard based on the colours on screen. 
It uses computer vision to selectively determine which colours are important and which are not.
